       # Inverse-Akash-Distribution-and-it-s-Applications
ABSTRACT: A new one parameter lifetime distribution named “Inverse Akash 
distribution” for modeling lifetime data has been introduced. Some important 
statistical properties of the proposed distribution including its shape characteristics 
of the density, hazard rate function, survival function, stochastic ordering, entropy 
measure, stress-strength reliability have been discussed. The maximum likelihood 
estimation of its parameter has been discussed. Two real data sets were employed 
in illustrating the usefulness of the new distribution and it was found that the 
Inverse Akash distribution provides a better fit when compared to the Inverse 
Exponential distribution and Inverse Lindley distribution. 
Keywords: Inverse Akash distribution, Stress-strength reliability model, Statistical 
properties, Maximum likelihood estimator and Goodness of fit
